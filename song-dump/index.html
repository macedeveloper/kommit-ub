        hey uh!
        <br>
        <br>this is also a heavy work on progress
        <br>
        <br>i havent really worked on any of the pages except for /ultrabox/ and
        the homepage
        <br>actually, i dunno, i wrote that at maybe two or three days after this got created
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>so uh
        <br>check back soon, i guess
        <br>
        <br>or not
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>dont expect this to be done
        <br>not for a loooooong while
        <br>
        <br>i still have to find and export all of my songs and code the whole site.
        <br>
        <br>both are very daunting tasks
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>anyways
        <br>
        <br>ive had this song on repeat for a while now
        <br>
        <br>https://open.spotify.com/track/0Xpm25EBeDlFp3G89nL8R7?si=b33879aad7f54282
        <br>
